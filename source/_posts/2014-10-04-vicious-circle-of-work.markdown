Sometimes I look back at 2007 with lot of regret. Ocasionally I regret
those moments of labour, when I made the biggest mistake of my life. The
mistake, whose consiquences I am facing till date, and probably will
face till end of my life. That mistake was, that I worked HARD for JEE.
That moment of weakness has shaped my future, still causing loads of
sleepless nights, wokring my ass off. Those nights just kicked-off
chain event in my life.

I came to IIT, and some of friends who didn't worked enough went to some
sub-IIT engineering college. Being in IIT, I was surrounded by people
from alll over the country, each of the used to be finishing at top of
food chain. Each of them with a habit of topping there classes. To just
to pass in such a enviornment, you need to work hard. 'Slow and steady'
fails here. You need run, and run hard to get anywhere there. You need
to work hard a lot to survive. While my friends were having it easy at
there colleges. Enjoying there lives with far healthier sex ratio tha
IITs.
IIT have the poorest sex ratio of all institutes, (except the boys
schools) I worked hard.

I was told just work hard for couple of year, and then just enjoy for
rest of your life. No one told me that this the biggest lie, I am being
told. No one tolde me, that this is a trap and I will never rest easy in
my life, ever again.

I was working hard in present wherever I was, in the hope that my future
will be easy. While I found that my future was never easier. All I did
was to made my present hard.

I worked hard to get into IITs ( India's allegedlly premier institutes
for enngineering education ), for

Once you start working hard then you just have to. Once you raise bar for
yourself, you can't look back. You'll just have to push it. That is how
we all are designed, that is what we are taught to us over and over,
that it is etched in our minds. One cannot

P.S: For the sake of being dramatic, I am saying that I worked hard for
JEE. But in truth, I didn't. I just got lucky. 8-)


Let me tell you a story of a boy called Johnny. Johnny was a happy boy.
He was of fun-loving and happy-go-lucky kind. Never worrying about a
thing in his life. He faced his life head-on. Just laid back and enjoyed
it. Everything was going well in his 'Neverland', but then he did
something so awful - so evil - that he will dread it whole of his life.
His life was so perfect with candies growing on tree, he was just HAPPY!
And suddenly it decame as dreadfull, as gloomy as winters of north pole.
While it was so sunny and warm in his life, It became dark and haunting.
And it was all his doing and he had no one to blame for it. He brought
it upon himself, being awfully mistaken that it will make his life
better. But it didn't ! It just back fired like a shotgun on his face,
whoose scars he will carry athroughout his life. And that dreadfull
mistake was that he worked hard for his exams!

Everyone just told him, how important was it to work hard for these
things, how important these exams were, and how his life depended on
them. How his life will turn a page, if he does well.

But what everyone failed to tell him was how dark and gloomy his life
will become after. And he willl never be in tthe 'Neverland' again. Like
Peter Pan, he would just outgrow it, inspite of how much he loved it,
how much he cling on to it.

It was like Morphious offering you blue and red pill in 'The Matrix' to
Neo. Blue pill will give you enlightenment, and give you knowledge. But
it will take away you current - easy and perfect life, which will just
never be back. It may be a noble cause to pursue and follow, but it is
not an easy one. What is so wrong with choosing the red pill? which
will let you be happy in your bubble. But will let you be happy in your
life. Which an elitist society, like ours, won't understand. Was it so
wrong to choose mediocrity in his life? As some great philosopher said
"Ignorance is bliss".

Hard work was like blue pill, once you choose it life will be a constant
struggle, an uphill battle for persevering higher and higher. You will
never be satisfied with you achievements, always wanting more, never
knowing when to stop. Every little achievement will make you hungrier
and hoarding more and more, with ever incresing "expectations" of
everyone including yourself. It will be a vicious circle sucking you in.
With even a small iota of it creating a need of thousand fold in you
life.

I am not pushing anyone to choose the red pill, neither endorsing it. An
elitist guy like Johnny may again choose blue pill for imself, inspite
of knowing all this. But I am just showing you the "Dark Side". As every
one should know every aspect of his decisions when they take them.
Everyone has a right to choose happiness for themselves -even it comes
at a price of mediocrity - insn't it the goal of pursuing anything ??

He shot in his foot with deciding to work on his JEE exams. He never
knew that this little thing will cause an endless stream of sleepless
night in his life, working endlessly. He never knew what he getting
himself into.

He did well in his exams and got into IITs - whech are the most
reputable engineering college in the country. While Johnny always found
it difficult to excell his classes in school, now he was expected to do
so in a place which had a selection of class toppers from all over the
country. He was in a place where he was needed to run, and run hard.
Where 'slow and steady' always loses the race. He was wrking harder and
harder just to survive, with no breathing room for him. Even a small nap
could leave him miles behind. While his friends outside were having it
easier. They for one enjoying there college life. Having fun and just
living it as it was meant to be, fun! All together with a far far
healthier sex-ratio. While Johnny's college hardly had any female, here
there were females in every circle. But Johnny was focused, remembering
what he was told, laughing wickedly at all, "Few more years, and then
you will rule it all!". He was preparing, working for the future, and he
will be someone.

Then came the placements, and Johnny got in. He got an A-List job on a
postions where his friends will take years and years to climb up to. His
dreams and visions were coming true. Now he can rest, he said to
himself. Now is is the time to have fun and just live it. But it proved
yet another false dawn.

He came to a job where everyone expected so much of him, after all he
was from an IIT, he was meant to be extra-ordinary at everything. They
all forget he was just a graduate, who was finding his feet. While his
friends were having training periods, he got piles and piles of work. He
was just thrown into the deep end. He was runningn again for his life,
strugling just to breathe, just to get it all in. He was working hard
with no one to teach him. Learning, studying and delivering all at the
same time. He can'thave the luxury to know his coleagues and
subordinates, or hangout with them. No he was working those nights. He
was working with people who were several years elder than him, who would
always see hima as a kid. And he couldn't hangout with people his age,
who were below him in the food chain, who will always see him as his
superior, their boss, event though he was none. So he just poured
himself to into his work, and hopes for a better tomorrow, and just be
happy.

But he just couldn't adapt, couldn't live like that anymore. So he
desires for more. He just couldn't go ahead with his education, as
choices for him were far and few. He just can't go to any college. They
were all beneath him, after he was from an IIT and working in an A-list
company. He was destined to thrive for more. So he decides to go ahead
with his lifelong dream, and starts his own company, in the hope that it
will become his beacon. He will finally do something and just enjoy it.
He will have fun and relax, and just be like others his age.

But he need to be better, because he could never settle, or his all hard
work will go in vain. So he had to do it more. He was like a gambler in
a casino, who is hooked up in the game and just can't leave, because he
has just vested in too much.

He thought his life was difficult and demanding before, but now it had
just blown out of proportion. Even his next meal depended on the way he
worked, the hours he invested and they became endless.

He never wanted this for himself. he just wanted to have fun and enjoy
life. And now he was struggling just to get hold of it. He never knew
that small bit of work he did long long time before will make his life
what it is. He was just told that few years of work and his life will be
golden. He will sip margerhitas on clouds. But it never was, no one told
him what it will truly be. A constant struggle to do better and improve.
which will lead to an ever threatening stakes of failure. Now he wonder
what could have been.
