Still figuring out how I can get some focused time, with high productivity.</li><li>I don’t mind being contacted at any time but I will likely only respond during week daytimes</li><li>I typically workout and meditate post office hours.</li><li>My Calendar is open and accessible so everyone can see my availability. I don’t mind people booking things in my calendar if I am free</li></ul><p>The best ways to communicate with me</p><ul><li>Asana is for any focused task specific communication, and my preferred choice.</li><li>Slack is the quickest way to get a response from me, with upto a few hours of response time.</li><li>Phone call me in case of emergency.</li><li>I keep on top of my emails each week and usually respond within a few days at the latest.</li></ul><p>The ways I like to receive feedback</p><ul><li>I’d rather have difficult conversations than things be unspoken or unauthentic, so just be straight-forward with me</li><li>I like receiving feedback face-to-face</li><li>I see all feedback as a learning opportunity so I like any feedback to include examples and also suggestions on how I / it could be better/different</li><li>I feel examples are the best way to communicate any feedback.</li></ul><p>Things I need</p><ul><li>I love discussions with people where we can freely think about what is possible without conditionals. Although I can be intense in such sessions, asking tough questions which may have no clear answers.</li><li>Authenticity - I find it really hard to be around bullshit, inconsistency or incongruence</li><li>Preparation is absolutely important for me. Any meeting is an expensive affair in terms of time. I get annoyed if people are unprepared.</li><li>I need time to reflect and simmer my thoughts.</li></ul><p>Things I struggle with</p><ul><li>If I don’t understand the wider purpose behind why we are doing something, I find it hard to engage with. For me getting this clarity is absolutely essential.</li><li>I’m an introvert so working “in the open” is something I have to work hard at</li><li>Too much critiquing and logical reasoning drains my energy</li><li>Unnecessary process - I love agile and lean because it is a great way of being transparent and creates a brilliant learning culture, however, it’s not always necessary. I like minimum-viable-process - what is enough for the size of the team, the type of project, the types of people and the types of outputs looking to be created. On the other hand, I find structure and rituals crucial. Process should also be measured through the outcome lens.</li></ul><p>Things I love</p><ul><li>I visualise myself as a futurist, always thinking about how we are evolving.</li><li>I like hearing what others are working on and connecting up the dots of what we are doing</li><li>A generative, risk-taking culture</li><li>Technology is something that I am always passionate about.</li><li>If I ever do a PhD, it will be in Cognitive sciences, distributed systems or complex networks. For me they all are the same things.</li></ul><p>Other things to know about me</p><ul><li>I try to be very rational about decision making</li><li>I am an INTP / INTJ cusp</li><li>I recently discovered love for tea</li><li>I believe a lot in being stoic. That somehow makes things actionable and keeps me moving.</li><li>I can get very passionate in discussion, being naturally an aggressive person, my body language can leak so. I may appear angry, but I am not. There is no impact on the relationship for me post a heated debate.</li><li>In meetings I can be too methodical - always delaying on deciding while taking conversation in several directions, so people find me hard to read. If I am not happy I will say so otherwise assume I am fine!</li><li>Fairness really matters to me. If I think someone is not being treated fairly, or someone is having an unfair impact on others, I will find it hard not to call out.</li><li>For me it is extremely important to treat others with empathy.</li></ul><p>My learning goals for 2020</p><ul><li>Improve on Marketing and Networking skills. I always believed that my work would speak for itself, although that has been the case mostly. But a little bit of new elements can unblock growth.</li><li>Write consistently. I feel writing is a thinking exercise. It has helped me clarify my thoughts.</li><li>Pick a hobby. For most of my life, I have treated my hobbies as my work, but sometimes the going gets tough and I will love a break from monotony.</li></ul></div><div class=post-footer><div class=info></div></div><div id=fb_comments_container><h2>Comments</h2><div id=disqus_thread></div><script type=application/javascript>var disqus_config=function(){};(function(){if(["localhost","127.0.0.1"].indexOf(window.location.hostname)!=-1){document.getElementById('disqus_thread').innerHTML='Disqus comments not available by default when the website is previewed locally.';return;}
