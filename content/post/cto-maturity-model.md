Bangalore and the rest of the South-east asian ecosystem have exploded with start-ups over the last couple of decades. There are too many opportunities, and the world is changing too quickly. Naturally, there is a deficiency in the market for seasoned professionals who can solve these problems. Lately, several people are reaching out, as they are looking for CTO. Several of them have no clue about what they need.

This reminded me about my conversation with my friend [Ajey](https://twitter.com/AjeyGore) - one of the most reputed CTOs in SEA. We were discussing how to decide what kind of CTO a company needs and at what stage.

A typical start-up goes through a lifecycle of maturity, in that process the kind of people it needs is also constantly changing. Even though the job title remains the same, what the person will do is completely different. A CTO job itself has a maturity model, which is closely tied to the company.

### Founder CTO

Founder CTO, is the person who joins right at the beginning when nothing is clear. She is the best buddy, a shit shoveler. Probably the most technical person in the initial team, she will do everything, even deciding lunch menus or muling conference T-Shirts.
If she grows with the company then excellent, else her role needs to evolve into something else, and with transition/expectation being carefully managed. Her role is to put things tactically together.

### Delivery CTO

In the seed plus stage, either a founder CTO will grow into this role or she needs to be hired. Mainly responsible for everything even if remotely engineering. She will focus on product building and getting results.

### Execution CTO

She is an excellent manager. She delegates crazily, and knows the art of delegation. While this might not be required but alongside brings in a lot of policy. Work she will do will be essential for headcount growth, as the company is growing to the stage where multi layers of management is needed. Delivery CTO could evolve into this role as she picks up a lot of management skills to complement her technical skills. But growing the organization becomes a top priority problem.

### Strategist or business focused CTO

As the engineering process matures, she abstracts them to founders and CEO. She is a really great manager. Now her focus can be on working on business strategy with the rest of the exec team, probably distant from engineering execution. And sometimes takes business to the next level.


So founders, who are hunting for a CTO for their start-up, should keep their focus on what problems need solving. Understand the stage that their company is at. People who have done different kinds of CTO roles may not be suitable for their start-ups. Also be mindful of discussing the role as various people can mean different things with titles you are using.
