I’m Shobhit, also known as [@Sinister_Light](https://twitter.com/Sinister_Light) on Twitter. I write about software, management and life. I would love to hear from you at me[at]sinisterlight.com.

Currently, I am the co-founder and CEO of [shovel.company](https://shovel.company/) - building tools for internet infrastructure. We are solving problems around Digital identity and working towards building a new protocols necessary for the modern world.

I started my first company in 2013, building a product called "Vocall", a WebRTC based video conferencing software, which went bust quickly within a year. I consequently started "CodeIgnition", a frontier DevOps startup with cofounders [Ajey](https://twitter.com/ajeygore), [Mehak](https://twitter.com/MehakKahlon), [Sumit](https://twitter.com/timusg) & [Shraddha](https://twitter.com/shraddhagore).

In 2015, we exited CodeIgnition to [Gojek](https://www.gojek.io/) - where I was SVP Product Engineering, running the Transport vertical and managing the CTO office. Shovel is my third startup, one I started after leaving Gojek in September 2020 with [Rishi](https://twitter.com/SageiEar) and [Prashant](https://twitter.com/prashant_mit).

I am deeply passionate about the future and technology. Complex networks and distributed systems are favourite topics I am constantly learning about. I love to work on data primitives and designed databases like [GossipDB](https://github.com/SinisterLight/gossipdb) - a gossip replication based embedded key-value store. While at Gojek, I architected [Ziggurat](https://github.com/gojek/ziggurat) - stream processing engine in clojure - which runs 100s applications within Gojek. I have been a co-author of the CNCF [Observability white-paper](https://github.com/cncf/tag-observability/blob/main/whitepaper.md) and organise [DevOpsDays India](https://devopsdaysindia.org/).

I care a lot about education as it empowers us to change our place in the world. Formal education is a place where kids get their first exposure to this shovel as a first-class system. I am involved in education through various initiatives - as a board member of Marudhara Foundation, [IIT Jodhpur](https://www.iitj.ac.in/) (my alma mater) and designing curriculum for 21st century schools for the state government of New Delhi, India.
