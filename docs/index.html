		<p>Let me tell you a story about a boy named Johnny. Johnny was a fun-loving guy, one of the happy-go-luck kinds. He never worried about a
thing in his life and faced his life head-on. He simply relaxed and enjoyed
every bit of life. Everything was going well in his &lsquo;Neverland&rsquo;, until he did
something so awful &ndash; so evil &ndash; that he would dread it, the whole of his life.
His life was so perfect with candies growing on trees, he was just HAPPY!
And then suddenly it became as dreadful and as gloomy as the winters at north pole. From everything being so sunny and warm in his life, It became dark and daunting.
And it was all his doings, and there was no one to blame for it. He brought
it upon himself, being awfully mistaken that this would make his life
better. But it didn&rsquo;t ! It just backfired, like a shotgun on his face,
whose scars he would carry throughout his life. And that dreadful
mistake was that he starting working hard for his exams!</p>

<p>Everyone told him, how important it was to work hard for examinations, how important these exams were, and how his life depended on the way he performs in
them. How his life will turn pages, if he does well. But what everyone
failed to tell him was how dark and gloomy his life will become after that.
And he will never be able to go back to the &lsquo;Neverland&rsquo;. Like Peter Pan, he will
just outgrow it, inspite of how much he loved it, and how much he wanted to cling back on
it.</p>

<p>He shot in his foot by deciding to work hard for his JEE exams. He never
knew that this effort will cause an endless stream of sleepless
nights in his life. He never knew what he getting
himself into.</p>

<p>He did well in his exams and got into IITs &ndash; which are among the most
reputable engineering colleges in the country. While Johnny always found
it difficult to exce inl his classes during school, no, he was expected to do
so in a place which had the class toppers from all over the
country. He was in a place where he needed to run, and run hard.
Where &lsquo;slow and steady&rsquo; would always lose the race. He was working harder and
harder just to survive, with no breathing room for himself. Even a small nap
could leave him miles behind. While his friends outside IIT were living truly. They, for one ,enjoyed their college life, having fun and just
living it as it was meant to be! All together with a much &ndash; much more
healthy sex-ratio. While Johnny&rsquo;s college hardly had any females, here
there were females in every circle. But Johnny was focused, remembering
what he was told, laughing wickedly at all saying in his mind, &ldquo;Few more years, and then
you will rule it all!&rdquo;. He was preparing, working for the future, and he
will be someone.</p>

<p>Then came the placements, and Johnny got in on the first day. He got an A-List job at a
position where his friends would take years and years to climb up to. His
dreams and visions were coming true. Now he could rest, he said to
himself. Now would be the time to have fun and just live it. But it proved to be
yet another false dawn.</p>

<p>He came to a job where everyone expected so much out of him. After all he
was from an IIT, he was meant to be extraordinary at everything. They
all forgot that he was just a graduate, who was finding his feet. While his
friends were having training periods, he got piles and piles of work. He
was just thrown into the deep end. He was running again for his life,
struggling just to breathe, just to get it all in. He was working hard
with no one to teach him. Learning, studying and delivering all at the
same time. He couldn&rsquo;t have the luxury to know his colleagues and
subordinates, or hangout with them. No, because he was working those nights. He
was working with people who were several years elder than him, who would
always see him as a kid. And he couldn&rsquo;t hang out with people his age,
who were below him in the food chain, who will always saw him as his
superior, their boss, even though he was none. So he just poured
himself to into his work, and hoped for a better tomorrow, and just tried to be be
happy.</p>

<p>But he just couldn&rsquo;t adapt, couldn&rsquo;t live like that anymore. So he
desired for more. He just couldn&rsquo;t go ahead with his education, as
choices for him were far and few. He just can&rsquo;t go to any college. They
were all beneath his stature, after all, he was from an IIT and working in an A-list
company. He was destined to thrive for more. So he decides to go ahead
with his lifelong dream, and started his own company, in the hope that it
will become his beacon. He will finally do something and just enjoy it.
He will have fun and relax, and just be like others his age. Thatâ€™ what he thought.</p>

<p>But he need to be better, because he could never settle, or his all hard
work will go in vain. So he had to do more. He was like a gambler in
a casino, who is hooked up in the game and just can&rsquo;t leave, because he
has just vested in too much.</p>

<p>He thought his life was difficult and demanding before, but now it had
just blown out of proportion. Even his next meal depended on the way he
worked, the hours he invested and they became endless.</p>

<p>He never wanted this for himself. He just wanted to have fun and enjoy
life. And now he was struggling just to get a hold of it. He never knew
that small bit of work he did long long time before, would make his life
what it is. He was just told that few years of work and his life will be
golden. He will sip margaritas on clouds. But it never was so, no one told
him what it will truly be. A constant struggle to do better and improve,
which will lead to ever threatening stakes of failure.</p>

<p>No one told him that it was the biggest lie, he was being told. No one
told him, that this was a trap and never again he will rest easy. He was
working hard in the present, wherever he was, in the hope that his future
will be easy. While his future was never easier, all he did was to make his
present harder.</p>

<p>Once you start working hard then you just have to keep doing it. Once you raise bar for
yourself, you can&rsquo;t look back. You&rsquo;ll just have to keep pushing it. That is how
we all are designed, that is what is etched in our minds.</p>

<p>It was like Morpheus offering you blue and red pill in &lsquo;The Matrix&rsquo; to
Neo. Blue pill will give you enlightenment, and give you knowledge. But
it will take away your current &ndash; easy and perfect life, which will just
never be back. It may be a noble cause to pursue and follow, but it is
not an easy one. What is so wrong with choosing the red pill, which
will let you be happy in your bubble? But will let you be happy in your
life, which an elitist society, like ours, won&rsquo;t understand. Was it so
wrong to choose mediocrity in his life? As some great philosopher said
&ldquo;Ignorance is bliss&rdquo;.</p>

<p>Hard work was like blue pill. Once you choose it, life will be a constant
struggle, an uphill battle for reaching higher and higher. You will
never be satisfied with your achievements, always keep wanting more, never
knowing when to stop. Every little achievement will make you hungrier
for more and more, with ever increasing &ldquo;expectations&rdquo; of
everyone including yourself, it will become a vicious circle sucking you in.
With even a small iota of it creating a need of thousand folds in you
life.</p>

<p>I am not pushing anyone to choose the red pill, neither endorsing it. An
elitist guy like Johnny may again choose blue pill for himself, despite
knowing all this. But I am just showing you the &ldquo;Dark Side&rdquo;. As every
one should know every aspect of the decisions when they take them.
Everyone has a right to choose happiness &ndash; even if it comes
at the price of mediocrity &ndash; isn&rsquo;t that the goal of pursuing anything??</p>

		<p>Digital ocean is a hugely popular cloud services provider. Recently
crossing 1 million launched VMs. With sophisticated UI and cheapest prices on the
block, they are providing an awesome service. They are frequently giving out
coupon codes making it easier/attractive to get started.</p>

<p>Digital ocean have several limitations as a cloud service provider,
but one thing they can boast of is <em><strong>less than a cent per hour hosting</strong></em>.
Their lowest droplet plan is of $5 per month, with respectable 512MB RAM.
SSD is the MVP for digital ocean, you see that written in big bold letters
on every advertisement out there. But interesting thing is that they give
 <strong>zero swap space</strong> by default.</p>

<p>Swap space is a dedicated memory for OS on disk, and their disk being SSDs should
be a lot faster than HDDs considering 0 seek time and multiple reads.
Technically there machines should have a very fast swap
space compared to other HDD based cloud services providers like, AWS.
But their default configuration has no swap. Their forums are cluttered user
complaining about &lsquo;out of memory&rsquo; issues of MySql and what not.</p>

<p>They are giving these cheap plans for the sake of <strong>&ldquo;Cheapest provider
in market&rdquo;</strong> tag. But they want their users to use larger machines.
They have written <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/community/articles/how-to-configure-virtual-memory-swap-file-on-a-vps">blog posts</a>
about how to enable swap space but they won&rsquo;t do it by default, knowing
very well most of the user won&rsquo;t do it at all and will just go for larger droplets
even if there RAM needs are minimal. This a silent way for them for discouraging
$5-10 low memory VMs.</p>

<p>Users are coming to there platform because they are most cost
efficient option out there
They start working on their lower performance VMs. This is a quiet intelligent and
disguised way for pushing them to use larger VMs. Cheaper VMs serve the
purpose of bringing users to there service and slowly out of memory issues appears.
Zero swap space is an intelligent way to make them feel that they need bigger droplets.</p>

<p>It would be interesting to see some metrics on how many users upgrade
there VMs from these smaller sizes compared to other service providers.</p>
